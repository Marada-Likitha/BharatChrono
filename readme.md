## About

BharatChrono is an Indian Historical Events Information Retrieval system done using Python, Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, pandas, scikit, nltk.I have used tf-idf and cosine similarity.

The output includes an event image, a brief summary, and a Wikipedia link, with events ranked by importance.

## Output - 

So this the input box where the user has to type the event name or the brief description about 
the event.

So for example when we type any event name or brief description of that event the system 
retrieves the information from the dataset based on what the user has typed and gives top 5 
matches to them.

For example here in the screenshot I have given the input Panipat so top5 matches are given.

The user has an option to search for more events by giving the event name or brief description 
to it . This works until he types quit . so when he does type quit and press enter it provides a 
message saying “Exiting the program. Thank you!”

When the event name or description is not matched with any of the events in the dataset.
